Also, scrum sprints are applied in this project. 4 sprints with a duration of 10 days are defined and followed.
Some development time is spent defining the database's structure and the database is implemented using MYSQL. 
The Election Machine must be implemented in a browser-based servlet technology. In general, the themes for this practice work are
•	Programming using Servlet technology
